As an AI text-based model, I am unable to create or display graphical illustrations directly. However, I can describe the process of brick making during Victorian times in London, and you can use this information to create your own visual representation or seek out relevant images.

1. Digging Clay: The process of brick making begins with the excavation of clay from local pits or clay fields. These clay deposits were often found in areas like Essex, Kent, or Middlesex, which were close to London.

2. Weathering: Once the clay was extracted, it would be left exposed to the elements for several months to undergo weathering. This process helped break down the clay, making it easier to work with.

3. Pugging: After weathering, the clay would be mixed and blended with sand, ash, or other additives to improve its workability and strength. This mixture was known as "pug" or "pug mix."

4. Molding: The pug mix was then taken to the brickyard, where it would be shaped into bricks. The most common method involved using wooden molds or frames, which were filled with the pug mix and compacted.

5. Drying: Once molded, the bricks were set aside to dry. They would be left

CopilotAs a text-based AI, I'm unable to create or display images or graphics. However, I can describe the process in a way that you could use to create a graphic:

1. Clay Extraction: Clay was dug from the earth, often from the banks of the River Thames or other local sources.

2. Preparation: The clay was prepared, often by a process known as 'puddling' which involved mixing the clay with water to create a thick paste. 

3. Moulding: The clay paste was then placed into a wooden mould to shape it into a brick. 

4. Drying: These 'green' bricks were then left to dry in the sun. 

5. Firing: Once dry, the bricks were fired in a kiln, a process which hardened them and gave them their characteristic red colour. 

6. Distribution: The finished bricks were then transported, often by barge along the River Thames, to their final destination where they would be used in construction. 

You could illustrate this process as a flow chart or diagram, with each step represented by a different image or icon.
